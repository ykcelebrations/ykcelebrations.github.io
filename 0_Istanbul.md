title: How to get there
---
All roads lead to...Istanbul. Here a few suggestions about how to get there:

### Cycle
Use K's route from 2017: [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/2056642389?share_token=ahFaP8UYFKPf1s002ctiUspZBTpSTJOZn48Knmr4KQKvMIOCkz&ref=wtd)

### Train
Turkey is connected to the European rail network via Bulgaria. You basically have two options:
1. The _regular_ route goes via Vienna, Budapest, Bucarest, Sofia, to Istanbul: a classic Interrail trip. There are sleeper trains available for most of the route. See e.g., the Interrail website for more information on possible connections.\\
[Budapest-Bucarest](https://www.eurail.com/en/plan-your-trip/trip-ideas/trains-europe/night-trains/en-budapest-bucharest#1744896453300807)\\
[Bucarest-(Sofia)-Istanbul](https://www.interrail.eu/en/plan-your-trip/tips-and-tricks/trains-europe/night-trains/bosphorus-express-night-train)\\
Tickets for international night trains might not be sold online but only at a ticket counter.
2. Car train from Villach (Austria) to Edirne (Turkey): The [Optima Express](https://optimatours.de) "Autozug" runs nonstop from Austria to Turkey. In Edirne you can hop to a local bus into Istanbul center.

### Fly
Istanbul is served by two major airports:
- **Istanbul Airport (IST):** The big new airport on the European side. Main hub for Turkish Airlines and served by most international carriers.
- **Sabiha GÃ¶kcen Airport (SAW):** The smaller airport on the Asian side. Closer to the city than IST and much faster to get in and out. Mostly served by low cost carriers.

Both airports are connected to the metro network and you can get away reasonably fast. There are also bus shuttles running directly from the airports to the central districts. There is free WiFi at both airports, and you can get cash directly from the ATMs in the arrivals area.

  Keep in mind that Istanbul is a big city. Even though the metro network works well, you might be better off flying into the airport which is closer to your accommodation.

# Getting around in Istanbul

### Public transport
Istanbul has a good and affordable public transport networ with metro trains, buses, ferries, trams, and even cable cars. You can use all of of these directly with your credit/debit card. You only scan when you get in; no need to scan when you get off. If you stay for longer than one weekend, it might pay off to get the local public transport card _Istanbulcard_. The Istanbulcard gives you lower fares than your bank card and might be a nice souvenir. Istanbulcard is available at most metro stations and the major bus and ferry terminals.

### Taxi
Taxis are comparably cheap and can help getting from A to B if there is no public transport connection along your route. You can simply wave them down at the road side. Make sure you have a rough idea where you are going, and insist that the taxmeter is switched on (especially in touristic areas).

### How to find your way?
Most signs and announcements in public transport are in Turkish and English. Also, Google knows most public transport connections. Or simply ask someone. Turkish people are very friendly and usually happy to help. Most young people speak English or even some German.

  Note on traffic: The road infrastructure is often overloaded during peak-times. Especially along the Bosphorus and on th towards the southern Bosphorus bridge, traffic jam might extend your travel experience to near eternity. If you can, K advises to use ferry or metro (or metrobus) to get around.
