title: Where to stay
---

There are tons of small and big hotels, hostels or Airbnbs all across town. Just use your booking portal of choice, this usually is very straight forward and uncomplicated in Istanbul. We recommend you to check in three major areas (rough boundaries see map below):
- **(Western) Kadiköy:** A lively and progressive district on the asian side. Many small shops, cafes, bars, and small hotels and hostels, but no major historic sites. Bus and metro to the wedding venue. Yagmur and Kilian will stay here. Best ice cream in town.
- **Taksim:** A busy district on the European side with loads of things to do. A mix of old and new, many big and small hotels, hostels, shops. Reasonably close to all major touristic sites. Connection to the wedding venue either by metro, or by ferry and bus/metro.
- **Üsküdar:** A rather quiet and conservative but central district. Fast transport connections to all important sites (wedding venue, Kadiköy, Taksim). Not so much to do here.

  Note: We discourage you to stay in Fatih/Sultanahmet. Even though most tourists will stay there due to its historic sites, this district is quite far away from our wedding venue. Also, you will very much feel like a tourist there, with certain places are infamous for their tourist scammers.

At this points, a not so exciting but important reminder: The earthquake risk in Istanbul is _high_. If there are any reasons that make you doubt the integrity of the hotel building, please give this one a miss and book another one.
