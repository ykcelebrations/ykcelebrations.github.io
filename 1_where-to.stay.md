title: Where to stay
---

There are tons of small and big hotels, hostels or Airbnbs all across town. Just use your booking portal of choice, this usually is very straight forward and uncomplicated in Istanbul. We recommend you to check in three major areas (rough boundaries see map below):
- **(Western) Kadiköy:** A lively and progressive district on the Asian side. Many small shops, cafes, bars, and several small hotels and hostels, but no major historic sites. Bus and metro to the wedding venue. Y&K will stay here. Best ice cream in town.
- **Taksim:** The most popular and busy district on the European side with loads of things to do. A mix of old and new, many big and small hotels, hostels, shops. Reasonably close to all major touristic sites. Connection to the wedding venue either by metro, or by ferry and bus/metro. Many rooftop terraces with stunning panoramic views. K particularly recommends the streets around Galata tower.
- **Üsküdar:** A rather quiet and conservative but central district. Fast transport connections to all important sites (wedding venue, Kadiköy, Taksim, historic sites). A few decent hotels but not so much to do here. Nice views over the Bosphorus.

  Note: We discourage you to book your accommodation in Fatih/Sultanahmet. Even though most tourists will stay there due to its historic sites, this district is quite far away from our wedding venue. Also, you will very much feel like a tourist there, with certain places being infamous for their tourist scammers.

At this points, a not so exciting but important reminder: The earthquake risk in Istanbul _is high_. If there are any reasons that make you doubt the integrity of the hotel building, please give this one a miss and book another one. For more information on earthquakes, see the official [information from the German consulate](https://tuerkei.diplo.de/tr-de/service/15-elefand/2632584-2632584) or the [USGS info page](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-should-i-do-during-earthquake).
