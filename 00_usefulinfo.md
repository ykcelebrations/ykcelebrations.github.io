Here some extra info for your stay.


### Mobile Internet
There are a few options for getting connected while in Turkey (from easy to lengthy):
1. Get a travel data package from your foreign telecommunication company.
2. Get an eSIM for Turkey.\
Important: add/activate the eSIM before you arrive to Turkey. Turkish authorities restrict foreign eSIMs in the country, and you might not be able to activate it from the Turkish network.
3. Use public WiFi / café hotspots / eduroam.
4. Get a Turkish SIM once you are in Turkey.\
This might be a lengthy process since they need to register your passport in their system. Likely easiest to do this directly at the airport, since staff knows the process there.


### Updated public transport info
The price for a single ride on public transport currently is TRY40 if you pay directly by credit/debit card. You can get better fares with the Istanbulcard, and discounts on connecting travel. You get the best fares if you register your Istanbulcard to your name: [Register](https://kisisellestirme.istanbulkart.istanbul/)


### Cash
We have not yet figured out which bank currently charges lowest feed for cash withdrawl. Historically, Halk Bank used to charge no fees. Reddit suggests this _might_ still be the case. Alternatively, you might want to try HSBC or Ziraat.\
Important: Don't forget to decline currency conversion. Always choose "local currency".
