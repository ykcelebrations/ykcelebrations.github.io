title: What to do
---

Istanbul is very diverse city of more than 16 million people. You will find lots of different neighbourhoods, and buildings more than 1500 years old to skyscrapers. There is incredinly much to do, and the city is constantly changing so that every time we visit, some of our favourite streets have changed a little. This section should give you some ideas where to go and what to check out, but we are sure you will find much more on your way. Some of Y&K's favourites are pinned in the map below:
